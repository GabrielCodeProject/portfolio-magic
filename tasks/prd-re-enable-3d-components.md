# Product Requirements Document: Re-enable 3D Components

## Introduction/Overview

Following the successful resolution of the React Three Fiber (R3F) runtime error "P is not part of the THREE namespace", we need to systematically re-enable the disabled 3D components (FloatingCandles, MovingPortraits, GoldenSnitch) that were temporarily commented out during debugging. This feature will restore the magical 3D interactive elements to the Harry Potter portfolio while ensuring robust error handling and performance optimization.

## Goals

1. **Progressive Re-enablement**: Safely restore 3D components one at a time to identify any remaining issues
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement device capability detection to disable components on low-end devices
3. **Error Resilience**: Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks to prevent site crashes
4. **Automated Testing**: Create test coverage for each 3D component to prevent future regressions
5. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to quickly revert to disabled state if issues arise

## User Stories

1. **As a visitor with a high-performance device**, I want to see floating candles, moving portraits, and golden snitch animations to experience the full magical portfolio.

2. **As a visitor with a low-end device**, I want the site to gracefully disable heavy 3D components and show fallback content so the site remains performant and usable.

3. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive error boundaries around 3D components so that if one component fails, it doesn't crash the entire application.

4. **As a developer**, I want automated tests for 3D components so I can catch regressions before they reach production.

5. **As a site owner**, I want the ability to quickly disable 3D components if performance issues are reported, without needing a full deployment.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Progressive Component Re-enabling
1.1. The system must re-enable 3D components in the following order: FloatingCandles → MovingPortraits → GoldenSnitch
1.2. The system must test each component individually before proceeding to the next
1.3. The system must uncomment the component imports in `src/app/page.tsx` one at a time
1.4. The system must verify each component renders without console errors

### 2. Performance Monitoring Integration
2.1. The system must detect device performance capabilities using GPU tier detection
2.2. The system must disable 3D components on devices with low GPU performance scores
2.3. The system must implement adaptive LOD (Level of Detail) based on device capabilities
2.4. The system must monitor frame rate and automatically reduce component complexity if FPS drops below 30
2.5. The system must provide performance metrics in development mode

### 3. Error Boundary Implementation
3.1. The system must wrap each 3D component with individual error boundaries
3.2. The system must display fallback components when 3D components fail to load
3.3. The system must log errors to console with component identification for debugging
3.4. The system must not crash the entire application when a single 3D component fails
3.5. The system must provide graceful degradation to 2D alternatives

### 4. Automated Testing
4.1. The system must include unit tests for each 3D component using React Three Test Renderer
4.2. The system must test component mounting/unmounting without errors
4.3. The system must test component interactions (mouse hover, click events)
4.4. The system must test error boundary activation and fallback rendering
4.5. The system must test performance monitoring triggers

### 5. Fallback Components
5.1. The system must provide static 2D alternatives for each 3D component
5.2. FloatingCandles fallback: CSS-animated flame icons
5.3. MovingPortraits fallback: Static portrait images with hover effects
5.4. GoldenSnitch fallback: CSS-animated golden orb with subtle movement
5.5. Fallback components must maintain the visual theme and layout

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Creating new 3D components or animations
- Modifying existing 3D component visual designs
- Adding new performance monitoring tools beyond what's needed
- Implementing user preferences for enabling/disabling 3D components
- Creating mobile-specific 3D optimizations
- Adding VR/AR capabilities

## Design Considerations

### Error Boundary Component Structure
```jsx
<ThreeErrorBoundary componentName="FloatingCandles" fallback={<CandlesFallback />}>
  <LazyFloatingCandles />
</ThreeErrorBoundary>
```

### Performance Monitor Integration
```jsx
<PerformanceGate minimumGPUTier={2} fallback={<StaticAlternative />}>
  <ThreeComponent />
</PerformanceGate>
```

### Progressive Loading Order
1. Uncomment LazyFloatingCandles (simplest component)
2. Test and verify in browser
3. Uncomment LazyMovingPortraits (medium complexity)
4. Test and verify in browser  
5. Uncomment LazyGoldenSnitch (most complex component)
6. Final integration testing

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- React Error Boundary for error handling
- GPU tier detection library (e.g., `detect-gpu`)
- React Three Test Renderer for testing
- Existing lazy loading infrastructure

### Performance Thresholds
- GPU Tier 0-1: Disable all 3D components
- GPU Tier 2: Enable FloatingCandles only
- GPU Tier 3+: Enable all components
- FPS threshold: Disable on sustained <30 FPS for 5 seconds

### Error Logging
- Component name identification
- Error stack traces in development
- Performance metrics when errors occur
- Browser/device information for debugging

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero Runtime Errors**: No R3F or component-related console errors after re-enabling
2. **Performance Compliance**: Maintain >30 FPS on target devices (GPU Tier 2+)
3. **Error Recovery**: 100% of 3D component failures result in fallback display, not crashes
4. **Test Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage for 3D components and error boundaries
5. **Progressive Loading**: Successfully enable components one-by-one without breaking previous components

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a user preference system for manually disabling 3D components?
2. What specific GPU performance thresholds should trigger component disabling?
3. Should fallback components be preloaded or loaded on-demand when 3D fails?
4. Do we need analytics to track 3D component performance across different devices?
5. Should we implement a "safe mode" URL parameter for debugging without 3D components?
