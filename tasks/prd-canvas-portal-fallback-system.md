# Product Requirements Document: Canvas Portal Fallback System

## Introduction/Overview

The Canvas Portal Fallback System is a comprehensive, extensible framework designed to provide robust fallback mechanisms for React Three Fiber (R3F) components while solving the critical "not part of the THREE namespace" runtime errors. This system will serve as the foundation for all future 3D component development, providing performance degradation handling, device compatibility fallbacks, accessibility support, and browser compatibility checks.

**Problem Statement**: Current R3F implementations fail when HTML elements are rendered inside Canvas contexts, causing namespace errors. Additionally, there's no systematic approach to handle performance degradation, accessibility requirements, or browser compatibility issues for 3D content.

**Goal**: Build a robust, extensible fallback framework that automatically adapts to different contexts and device capabilities while maintaining optimal performance and user experience.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate R3F namespace errors** by providing context-aware rendering that prevents HTML elements in Canvas contexts
2. **Create an extensible architecture** that supports multiple fallback strategies (performance, accessibility, browser compatibility)
3. **Implement adaptive performance management** that automatically adjusts 3D content based on device capabilities
4. **Provide comprehensive accessibility support** with alternative content for users who cannot view 3D content
5. **Ensure cross-browser compatibility** with graceful degradation for browsers without WebGL support
6. **Maintain minimal performance overhead** while providing rich fallback capabilities
7. **Enable easy integration** with existing 3D components through light to moderate refactoring

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Developers
1. **As a developer**, I want to add fallback support to existing 3D components with minimal code changes so that I can quickly improve user experience without major refactoring.

2. **As a developer**, I want the system to automatically detect Canvas contexts so that I don't have to manually manage different rendering paths for HTML vs 3D content.

3. **As a developer**, I want to define custom fallback strategies for different scenarios so that I can provide tailored experiences for loading, errors, performance issues, and accessibility needs.

### Secondary Users: End Users
4. **As a user with a low-end device**, I want to see appropriate fallbacks when 3D content can't perform well so that the site remains usable and responsive.

5. **As a user with disabilities**, I want alternative content when 3D elements aren't accessible so that I can still understand and interact with the site's content.

6. **As a user with an older browser**, I want the site to work gracefully without 3D features so that I'm not blocked from accessing the main content.

7. **As any user**, I want clear loading states and error messages when 3D content fails so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Infrastructure

1. **Context Detection System**
   - The system MUST automatically detect whether a component is rendering inside an R3F Canvas context
   - The system MUST provide a React context provider for managing Canvas state

   - The system MUST provide performance metrics for adaptive decision-making

5. **Adaptive Performance Fallbacks**

   - The system MUST monitor frame rates and adjust quality dynamically
   - The system MUST respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Accessibility Support

6. **Alternative Content Provision**
   - The system MUST provide text descriptions for 3D scenes
   - The system MUST support keyboard navigation alternatives
   - The system MUST integrate with screen readers
   - The system MUST respect accessibility preferences and system settings

7. **User Control Options**
   - The system MUST allow users to disable 3D content entirely
   - The system MUST provide controls for adjusting 3D quality/performance
   - The system MUST remember user preferences across sessions

### Browser Compatibility

8. **WebGL Support Detection**
   - The system MUST detect WebGL availability and version
   - The system MUST provide fallbacks for browsers without WebGL support
   - The system MUST handle WebGL context loss gracefully
   - The system MUST provide informative messages for unsupported browsers

### Developer Experience

9. **Simple Integration API**
   - The system MUST provide drop-in wrapper components for existing 3D elements
   - The system MUST support declarative fallback configuration
   - The system MUST provide TypeScript definitions and IntelliSense support
   - The system MUST include comprehensive error messages and debugging information

10. **Extensibility Support**
    - The system MUST allow custom fallback strategies without modifying core code
    - The system MUST provide hooks for custom context detection logic
    - The system MUST support theme integration for consistent UI
    - The system MUST enable custom performance thresholds and metrics

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Initial version will focus on client-side rendering only
2. **3D Content Creation Tools** - System will not provide tools for creating 3D assets
3. **Advanced Graphics Pipeline** - Will not implement custom rendering pipelines beyond R3F
4. **Mobile App Support** - Focus on web browsers only, mobile web support through responsive design
5. **Real-time Collaboration** - No multiplayer or real-time synchronization features
6. **Content Management** - No built-in asset management or CDN integration
7. **Analytics Integration** - Performance metrics for internal use only, no external analytics

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern** for different fallback rendering approaches
- **Provider Pattern** for context management and dependency injection
- **Plugin Architecture** for extensible fallback types
- **Observer Pattern** for performance monitoring and adaptive responses

### Component Hierarchy
```
CanvasPortalProvider (Context + Portal Management)
├── PerformanceMonitor (Device Detection + Metrics)
├── FallbackOrchestrator (Strategy Selection)
│   ├── PerformanceFallback (Low-end device handling)
│   ├── AccessibilityFallback (Screen reader support)

└── AdaptiveSuspense (Enhanced Suspense with fallback logic)
```

### Styling and Theming

- **React Three Fiber v9+** for latest R3F patterns and performance
- **@react-three/drei** for utility components (Text, Html)
- **Existing theme system** for consistent UI styling

### Performance Requirements

- **Modern browsers** (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+)
- **Graceful degradation** for older browsers
- **Mobile browser optimization** for iOS Safari and Chrome Mobile

### Integration Points
- **Existing 3D components** (FloatingCandles, MovingPortraits, GoldenSnitch)
- **Theme system** for consistent styling
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling
- **Performance monitoring** hooks and utilities

## Success Metrics

2. **Reduced bounce rate** on pages with 3D content for low-end devices
3. **Faster perceived loading times** through better loading state management
4. **Increased user engagement** with adaptive performance features

## Open Questions

1. **Caching Strategy**: Should we cache device capability detection results across browser sessions? What's the appropriate cache invalidation strategy?

2. **Performance Thresholds**: What specific FPS thresholds should trigger automatic quality reduction? Should these be configurable per component?

3. **Accessibility Standards**: Which specific WCAG guidelines should we prioritize for 3D content accessibility? Should we support ARIA labels for 3D objects?

4. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle partial failures (e.g., some 3D assets load, others fail)? Should there be automatic retry mechanisms?

5. **User Preference Persistence**: Should user performance/accessibility preferences be stored in localStorage, cookies, or require external storage integration?

6. **Bundle Size Impact**: What's the acceptable bundle size increase for the fallback system? Should advanced features be code-split?

7. **Testing Strategy**: How do we effectively test 3D fallbacks across different devices and browsers? Should we include visual regression testing for 3D content?

8. **Migration Path**: What's the recommended approach for migrating existing components that already have custom loading states? Should there be a compatibility layer?
