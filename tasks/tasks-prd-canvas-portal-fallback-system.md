# Tasks: Canvas Portal Fallback System Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/components/3D/CanvasPortalProvider.tsx` - Main context provider for Canvas detection and portal management

- `src/hooks/useCanvasContext.ts` - Hook for Canvas context detection and fallback utilities
- `src/hooks/useCanvasContext.test.ts` - Unit tests for the Canvas context hook
- `src/components/3D/fallback/FallbackOrchestrator.tsx` - Strategy pattern implementation for fallback selection
- `src/components/3D/fallback/FallbackOrchestrator.test.tsx` - Unit tests for fallback orchestration
- `src/components/3D/fallback/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Device capability detection and performance monitoring
- `src/components/3D/fallback/PerformanceMonitor.test.tsx` - Unit tests for performance monitoring
- `src/components/3D/fallback/AdaptiveSuspense.tsx` - Enhanced Suspense wrapper with context-aware fallbacks
- `src/components/3D/fallback/AdaptiveSuspense.test.tsx` - Unit tests for adaptive suspense component
- `src/types/fallback.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for the fallback system
- `src/utils/fallback/deviceDetection.ts` - Utility functions for device capability detection

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
