## R3F Runtime Error Fix - "P is not part of the THREE namespace"

### Issue Description

The application was experiencing React Three Fiber (R3F) runtime errors:

- `R3F: P is not part of the THREE namespace! Did you forget to extend?`
- `R3F: Div is not part of the THREE namespace! Did you forget to extend?`

### Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by HTML elements (`<p>`, `<div>`) being rendered inside the React Three Fiber Canvas context. In R3F, only THREE.js objects (like `<mesh>`, `<group>`, `<pointLight>`, etc.) can be used inside a Canvas. When HTML elements are rendered inside a Canvas, R3F tries to interpret them as THREE.js objects, causing namespace errors.

**Solution**: Replaced with 3D-safe alternatives

```typescript
// FIXED - No HTML elements in Canvas context
const defaultPlaceholder = null;
const loadingPlaceholder = null;

return (
  <group>
    {shouldLoad ? (
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        {children}
      </Suspense>
    ) : null}
  </group>
);
```

#### 3. Dynamic Component Loading

**Problem**: HTML loading spinners in Canvas context

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC
loading: () => (
  <LoadingSpinner
    size="lg"
    variant="magical"
    text="Loading 3D component..."
  />
),
```

**Solution**: Use null fallback for Canvas context

```typescript
// FIXED
loading: () => null, // Avoid HTML elements in Canvas context
```

### Key Principles for R3F Development

1. **Canvas Context Rule**: Only THREE.js objects can be rendered inside `<Canvas>`
2. **HTML Elements**: Use outside Canvas or replace with 3D equivalents (`<group>`, `<mesh>`, etc.)
3. **Loading States**: Use `null` or 3D objects for fallbacks inside Canvas
4. **Extend Function**: Not needed in R3F v9+ for standard THREE objects

### Verification

After applying these fixes:

- No more R3F namespace errors in console
- 3D components load properly
- Application performance improved
- Clean console logs with only React DevTools info message
